# JobInterview-Admin

Second task for Belgrade Institute of Technology javaScript bootcamp certification.

A responsive administrative panel web application, which can be used by anyone, and which is responsible for creating/modifying/deleting Interview Reports.

The app consists of a Report List Page (the landing page) and a Submit Report Page.

The Report List Page uses a list layout with basic report info shown. It also enables deleting entries and viewing reports in more detail (using a modal dialog), as well as filtering reports through keyword search.

The Submit Report Page features a three-step "wizard": firstly, a candidate is selected from a list, then the same is done with a company. Each list can be filtered by name. Finally, report details are filled and the report submitted.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ES6, React, Webpack, Babel.
